    description: Only Pull Requests created against default branch can have label `major` set
    
    introduction: |-
      This is a GitHub Action to validate that only Pull Requests targeting the default branch can have the `major` label set. This is useful in combination with the [`release-drafter`](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) and the Cloud Posse [`release-branch-manager`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-release-branch-manager) GitHub Actions.
    
    usage: |-
      ```yaml
        name: validate-release-labels
    
        on:
          pull_request:
            types:
              - labeled
              - unlabeled
              - opened
              - synchronize
              - reopened
